* Introduction

This is mostly an exploration of Idris2 and dependent types. I have no idea what
I am doing but hope this will be useful to others as a reference, hence no
license at the moment.

I will be using Agda, Haskell, Idris2, Scala3, and other languages as a
reference along many of the libraries for said languages.

Upstream is at nest.pijul.com/fabian/veribase-idr2 and git / github are
considered mirrors. Regardless to say, this is going to be very unstable for the
time being.
